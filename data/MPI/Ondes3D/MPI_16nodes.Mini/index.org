*** By rktesser:

At first, I had registered only the flops for the computations, by setting MINI_TIME=0. By suggestion of prof. Arnaud Legrand, I re-generated the traces, registering the durations of the computations (MINI_TIME=1). 

To replay this trace, using times instead of flops, I'll need to set the computing power of the machines to 1 in the platform description. The time is an extra field in the computing event. I does not replace the flops. So, I also needed to make a modification to smpi_replay, in order to use computation times instead of flops, when the times are present in the trace.
